# RayTracerV1

Hello! If you're reading this that means you found my raytracer! I hope you find it as cool as I do!

If you want to try it out for yourself, here's how to run it:

compile it on the command line using "g++ -o main main.cpp"

and then run it using ./main width height startFrame endFrame

ex. "./main 1920 1080 1 1"
